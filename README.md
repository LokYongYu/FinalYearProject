# FinalYearProject
This is the file contain my final year project. main.cpp contain the C program provided by the FMC150 Vendor. I have made various configuration with the code such as communicate through ethernet, produce complete sine wave and square wave form.
The Control_QucikSyn file is used to control the frequency generated by quciksyn(microwave synthesizer|FSL-0010).
The rest of the .py file is the program i wrote for data analysis.
